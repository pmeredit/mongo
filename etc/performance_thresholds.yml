#            This file contains thresholds for performance tests run by resmoke. These correspond to   #
#            the GenerateAndCheckPerfResults hook. Thresholds are set on a per variant basis.          #
#            Make sure to set the --variantName flag when running benchmarks in resmoke.               #

#            Each entry should follow the format below                                                 #

#
#
#
#
#     Bound direction upper means that the value reported by the test must be BELOW the threshold value.
#     Bound direction lower means that the value reported by the test must be ABOVE the threshold value.

tests:
  # The current suggested method for raising these values is to run the
  # benchmark a few times in patches, and comparing to the recent history.
  # From the benchmark's history page, obtain a "stable region mean"
  # and "CV of stable region". These are available in the "Trend Charts" tab on
  # Evergreen for the `benchmarks_sep` task.
  #
  # The deviations of these metrics are extremely tight.
  # We can easily accept 2 standard deviations up from the stable mean.
  #
  #     threshold = mean * (1 + 2 * cv)
  #
  # 2025-02-16:
  #     Router/1:  mean=20077, cv=.0228 => threshold=20993
  #     Router/32: mean=20111, cv=.0227 => threshold=21024
  #     Shard/1:   mean=22013, cv=.0290 => threshold=23290
  #     Shard/32:  mean=22087, cv=.0289 => threshold=23364
