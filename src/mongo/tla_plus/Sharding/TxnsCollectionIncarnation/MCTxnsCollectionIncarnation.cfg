INVARIANTS
    \* -- Spec correctness invariants. Disabled by default, used to catch specification issues. 
    \* -- Enable when making significant changes to the spec.
    \* TypeOK
    \* RouterSendsOneStmtRequestPerShard
    \* -- Protocol correctness invariants. Must always be enabled.
    CommittedTxnImpliesAllStmtsSuccessful
    CommittedTxnImpliesConsistentKeySet
    \* -- Bait invariants. Selectively enable one to generate a counter example trace.

    \* BaitHappyPath
    \* BaitTrace

\* Temporal property violations may not be detected in the presence of state constraints. To check 
\* temporal properties, disable CONSTRAINTS. And when enabling CONSTRAINTS, disable all PROPERTIES 
\* to speed up model checking. Keeping PROPERTIES enabled simultaneously with CONSTRAINTS slows down 
\* model checking without actually catching any violations. Similarly, symmetry sets should not be 
\* used when checking liveness properties. Doing so can make TLC fail to find errors, or to report 
\* nonexistent errors.
