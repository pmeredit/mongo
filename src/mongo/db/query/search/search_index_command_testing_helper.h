// In production sharded clusters, search index commands are received by mongos which forwards them
// to the SearchIndexManagement service (Envoy) which are then routed to MMS and stored in the
// control plane DB. The mongots makes regular calls to the control plane to get the updated set of
// search indexes.

// However, server testing's infrastructure uses mongot-localdev which is a special mongot binary
// used for local (eg not on Atlas) development.  As such, server's testing infrastructure does not
// have a control plane for managing search index commands. Instead mongot-localdev receives all
// search index commands itself.

// Moreover, the testing environment deploys each mongod with its own mongot (for purposes of server
// testing, "mongot" is a shorthand for "mongot-localdev"). Thus the search index command needs to
// be forwarded to all mongots in the cluster. Previously, this was done via a javascript library
// function that would repeat the search index command on every mongod in the cluster. However, in
// sharded clusters, the views catalog lives exclusively on the primary shard, therefore secondary
// shards cannot resolve the view without making a call to the primary. To support server testing of
// sharded mongot-indexed views, the following system was devised:

// 1. The javascript search index helper calls the search index command on the collection.
// 2. mongos receives the search index command, resolves the view name if necessary, and forwards
// the command to it's assigned mongot (eg searchIndexManagementHostAndPort) which it
// shares with the last spun up mongod.
// 3. mongot completes the request and mongos retrieves the response.
// 4. mongos replicates the search index command on every mongod. It does so by asynchronously
// multicasting _shardsvrRunSearchIndexCommand (with the original user command, the
// alreadyInformedMongot hostAndPort, and the optional resolved view name) on every mongod in the
// cluster.
// 5. Each mongod receives the _shardsvrRunSearchIndexCommand command. If this mongod shares its
// mongot with mongos, it does nothing as its mongot has already received the search index command.
// Otherwise, mongod calls runSearchIndexCommand with the necessary parameters forwarded from
// mongos.
// 6. Once every mongod has forwarded the search index command, mongos returns the response from
// step 3.
