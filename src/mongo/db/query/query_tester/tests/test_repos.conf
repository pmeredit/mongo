# This file contains a mapping of repos that contain generated tests
# we want to run using query_tester and the commit hash that we want to use.
# We need a specific commit hash to ensure that all outstanding tickets opened prior to
# a test corpus change are unaffected.
#
# If a SERVER ticket requires changes in any of the test results,
# the commit hash of the new test results should replace the existing
# commit hash for any affected repos.
#
# Format: <repo-name>:<commit-hash>
