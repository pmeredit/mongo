\f0\b\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2 \strokec2 9. Limitation of Liability.
\f2\b0\fs24 \cf3 \strokec3 \

\f0\b\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2 \strokec2 (a)
\f1\b0  Except as set forth in Section 9(b), neither party will be liable to the other for: (i) any incidental or consequential damages, including lost profits or business opportunities, or any special or punitive damages; or (ii) an amount that exceeds the total fees payable to MongoDB by Customer under this Agreement during the 12-month period before the event giving rise to the liability.
\f2\fs24 \cf3 \strokec3 \

\f0\b\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2 \strokec2 (b)
\f1\b0  Each party\'92s cumulative liability under Section 10 will not exceed $3,000,000. Nothing in this Agreement limits either party\'92s liability for: (i) fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; (ii) death or personal injury caused by negligence, gross negligence or intentional misconduct; (iii) Customer\'92s payment obligations; or (iv) any liability which cannot legally be limited.
\f2\fs24 \cf3 \strokec3 \

\f0\b\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2 \strokec2 10. Indemnification.
\f2\b0\fs24 \cf3 \strokec3 \

\f0\b\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2 \strokec2 (a) Customer Indemnification.
\f1\b0  If a third party asserts a claim against MongoDB alleging that software, content or data used by Customer in connection with the Software or any Subscription, or provided to MongoDB in order for MongoDB to perform Consulting Services, infringes a third party\'92s intellectual property right (a 
\f0\b \'93Claim Against Us\'94
\f1\b0 ), Customer will defend MongoDB against the Claim Against Us at Customer\'92s expense and indemnify MongoDB from any damages, reasonable legal fees and costs finally awarded against MongoDB to the extent resulting from the Claim Against Us or for amounts paid by MongoDB to settle the Claim Against Us. Customer will have no obligation to defend or indemnify MongoDB if the Claim Against Us is based on MongoDB\'92s unauthorized changes to Customer\'92s software, content, data or other information.
\f2\fs24 \cf3 \strokec3 \

\f0\b\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2 \strokec2 (b) MongoDB Indemnification. 
\f1\b0 If a third party asserts a claim against Customer that the Software infringes a third party\'92s intellectual property right or any Deliverable infringes a third party\'92s copyright (a 
\f0\b \'93Claim Against You\'94
\f1\b0 ), MongoDB will defend Customer against the Claim Against You at MongoDB\'92s expense and indemnify Customer from any damages, reasonable legal fees and costs finally awarded against Customer to the extent resulting from the Claim Against You or for amounts paid by Customer to settle the Claim Against You. MongoDB will not be obligated to defend or indemnify Customer if the Claim Against You is based on: (i) combination of the Software with other software, content, data or business process not contemplated by Documentation; (ii) use of any older release of the Software when use of a newer version would have avoided the alleged or actual infringement; (iii) any modification of the Software made by anyone other than MongoDB; or (iv) MongoDB's compliance with any materials, designs, specifications or instructions provided by Customer.
\f2\fs24 \cf3 \strokec3 \

\f0\b\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2 \strokec2 (c) Infringement Remedies.
\f1\b0  In addition to MongoDB\'92s indemnity obligations, if the Software or any Deliverable becomes, or in MongoDB\'92s opinion is likely to become, the subject of an infringement claim, MongoDB may at its option and expense and as Customer\'92s sole and exclusive remedy: (i) procure for Customer the right to make continued use of the Software or Deliverable; (ii) replace or modify the Software or Deliverable so that it becomes non-infringing; or (iii) terminate Customer\'92s license to the Software or Deliverable and refund any prepaid fees for unused Subscriptions.
\f2\fs24 \cf3 \strokec3 \

\f0\b\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2 \strokec2 (d) Indemnification Procedures.
\f1\b0  Each party will provide the other with prompt notice of any claim. A party\'92s failure to provide prompt notice to the other party relieves the party of its obligation to defend and indemnify the other party only to the extent that the failure to provide notice materially harms the party\'92s ability to defend the claim. The indemnifying party will have sole control of the defense of the claim, including any settlement. The indemnified party will provide the indemnifying party with reasonable cooperation in connection with the defense of the claim, and may participate in the defense at its own expense. This Section 10 sets forth each party\'92s exclusive remedy for any third party infringement claim.
\f2\fs24 \cf3 \strokec3 \

\f0\b\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2 \strokec2 11. Term and Termination. 
\f1\b0 The term of this Agreement commences when you agree to an Order Form, or you download our Software for a free trial, and will remain in effect until terminated in accordance with this Agreement. Either party may terminate this Agreement for convenience immediately upon notice if all Order Forms under this Agreement have expired or been terminated. Neither party may terminate an Order Form for convenience. If a party fails to cure a material breach of this Agreement within 30 days after receipt of written notice of the breach, the other party may terminate this Agreement and any affected Order Form. Upon termination of an Order Form or this Agreement, you will remove the Software from all Servers covered by the terminated Subscriptions. Provisions intended by their nature to survive termination of this Agreement survive termination. During the term of this Agreement and one year following termination, we may inspect your records relating to your use of the Software or Consulting Services for the purposes of verifying compliance with this Agreement.
