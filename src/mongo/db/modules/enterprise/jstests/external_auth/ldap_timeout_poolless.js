    //  - kConnectionFailPoint: runClients() launches shells that try to auth as ldapz_ldap1. The
    //    first 'slowResponses' clients will be delayed by slowDelaySecs to get a connection to the
    //    LDAP server, which will cause auth to take at least slowDelaySecs to complete. The
    //    remaining clients will auth in less than slowDelaySecs.
    //  - kBindFailPoint: runClients() launches shells that try to auth as ldapz_ldap1. The first
    //    'slowResponses' clients will be delayed by slowDelaySecs when binding to the LDAP server
    //    which will cause auth to take at least slowDelaySecs to complete. The remaining clients
    //    will auth in less than slowDelaySecs.
    //  - kSearchFailPoint: runClients() launches shells that execute usersInfo for ldapz_ldap1. The
    //    first 'slowResponses' clients will be delayed by slowDelaySecs when searching for LDAP
    //    group membership on the LDAP server for ldapz_ldap1. Since the server can only process one
    //    usersInfo command at a time, the delays will propagate and multiply for the last clients
    //    served. However, usersInfo has a built-in maxTimeMS timeout which should be less than
    //    slowDelaySecs, so all usersInfo invocations should either fail due to timeout or due to
