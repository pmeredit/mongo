/*
 * Tests that nodes in FCBIS are considered a part of the liveness majority. This test starts with a
 * two-node replica set. We then add a secondary and force it to hang in FCBIS. We proceed to remove
 * all communication for the other secondary. We verify that the primary does not step down and no
 * elections were called, since the node in FCBIS contributes to the liveness majority. Finally, we
 * verify that nodes in FCBIS are able to vote in an election. This is done by stepping down the
 * primary, waiting for it to become a secondary, and allowing it to run for primary again. Since
 * the other secondary is disconnected, the primary must receive a vote from the FCBIS node to get
 * elected again.
