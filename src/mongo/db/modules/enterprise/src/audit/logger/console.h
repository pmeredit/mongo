 * The Console type is synchronized such that only one instance may be in the fully constructed
 * state at a time.  Correct usage is to instantiate one, write or read from it as desired, and
 * then destroy it.
 *
 * The console streams accept UTF-8 encoded data, and attempt to write it to the attached
 * console faithfully.
 *
 * TODO(schwerin): If no console is attached on Windows (services), should writes here go to the
 * event logger?
