/**
 * MongoDB exposes two separate client APIs for locking down files on disk for a file-system based
 * backup that require only one pass of the data to complete. First is using the `fsync` command
 * with `lock: true`. The second is using the `$backupCursor` aggregation stage. It does not make
 * sense for both techniques to be concurrently engaged. This class will manage access to these
 * resources such that their lifetimes do not overlap. More specifically, an `fsyncLock` mode can
 * only be freed by `fsyncUnlock` and `openBackupCursor` by `closeBackupCursor`.
 *
 * Failure to comply is expected to be due to user error and this class is best situated to detect
 * such errors. For this reason, callers should assume all method calls can only fail with
 * uassert exceptions.
